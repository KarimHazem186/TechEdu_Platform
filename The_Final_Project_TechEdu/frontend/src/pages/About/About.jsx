                            TechEdu has truly helped to democratize education. I was born in Trinidad and Tobago, and I have lived in Jamaica and the United States. I have received emails from students in all three locations who have taken my course on the Coursera platform.
                            I don't believe Coursera is focused on education alone. Coursera is in the business of reaching learners and changing lives.

                        TechEdu was founded by AbdelGafor Elboray and Gafar in 2024 with a vision of
                        providing life-transforming learning experiences to learners around the world.
                        Today, Coursera is a global platform for online learning and career development
                        that offers anyone, anywhere, access to online courses and degrees from
                        leading universities and companies. Coursera received B Corp certification in
                        February 2021, which means that we have a legal duty not only to our
                        shareholders, but to also make a positive impact on society more broadly, as we
                        continue our efforts to reduce barriers to world-class education for all. 148
                        million learners and more than 7,000 campuses, businesses, and governments
                        have come to Coursera to access world-class learningâ€”anytime, anywhere.
